Hi! My name is Jack Moyen. I'm a full-time student at RIT, aiming for my Master's degree in Game Design/Development! I love finding cool rocks, playing video games, and making video games! I love to create worlds and be creative, and I hope to use my time at RIT to make connections and pursue a career of making indie games!
